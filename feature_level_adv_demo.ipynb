These issues are more likely if a cell is stopped mid-execution and restarted. \n","- If you want things to run more quickly, you can often get away with reducing ```n_batches```. \n","- Targeted, universal attacks tend to have have variable success, especially when optimizing for a complex objective as in our case. So always run multiple trials. You can also increase the patch/perturbation size if you want attacks that are more successful on average. \n","- Attacks tend to be the easiest to produce when using semantically-related source/target class pairs such as bee/fly or pufferfish/lionfish. \n","- You can modify the ```latent_i``` param to change which block of the generator the perturbation is trained in. Using the very last one (```latent_i=13```) will result in a standard pixel-space attack. \n","- You can play around with the loss hyperparameters to get attacks optimized more or less for different parts of the objective. \n","- This code should be fairly easy to modify for your own experiments. The key functions to play with will be ```patch_adversary```, ```region_generalized_patch_adversary```, ```custom_loss_patch_adv```, and ```custom_loss_region_gen_patch_adv```. \n","- If you have questions or feedback, just email us. We're friendly and excited about interpretable adversarial features. We can also discuss ideas for future work.
